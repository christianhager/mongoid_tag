= Mongoid Tag

This gem is heaviliy influenced by Aaron Qians mongoid_taggable_with_context gem. I needed a way to tag a model and let a contextual scope of that model hold meta-data about the tags.

In example: when I tag a product with "nice", I wanted the products category to know how many products was tagged with "nice". I also wanted to store additional data about this tag such as color (i.e colored labels on gmail.)


== NOTE
  This is my first gem ever, and it is experimental at the moment.

== Usage

  class Product
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Tag
    belongs_to :category
    tag :tags, :meta_in => :category
  end

  class Category
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Tag::Meta
    tag_meta_for :tags
  end

  @c = Category.create
  @product = Product.create(:tags => "new, expensive", :category => @c)

  @product.tags => ["new", "expensive"]

  @category.tags_with_weight => [["new", 1], ["expensive", 1]]

  @category.add_tag("on sale", {:color => "#a2a2a2"}) #add any meta you want

  @category.tags_with_meta => [["new", {:count => 1}], ["expensive", {:count => 1}], ["on sale", {:count => 0, :color => "#a2a2a2"}]]
